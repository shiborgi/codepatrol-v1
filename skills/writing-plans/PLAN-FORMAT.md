# Plan format

Write the accepted implementation instructions to `.codepatrol/changes/<work-id>/plan/plan.md`. It implements the adjacent `spec.md` and must be usable without conversation history. Execution state belongs in `apply/journal.md`, so implementation never changes this file.

## Header and coverage

```markdown
# Plan — <name>

- Work id: `<work-id>`
- Governing spec: `spec.md`
- Target baseline: <same baseline as spec>

## Goal and approach

<Goal plus the chosen architecture in enough detail to orient every task.>

## Global constraints

<Project requirements, version floors, naming, compatibility, security,
performance, accessibility, operability, and forbidden scope that apply to all tasks.>

## Simplicity proof

- Selected rung: <the approved spec decision>
- Reused capabilities: <existing module, runtime, platform, or dependency>
- Forbidden speculative surface: <options, abstractions, dependencies, or configuration with no current criterion>
- Expected surface delta: <files, dependencies, public interfaces, configuration, and runtime state>

## Acceptance mapping

| Criterion | Task(s) | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | T1, T3 | `<exact command or inspection>` |

## Dependency order

`T1 → T2`; `T3` is independent of `T2` and owns different files.
```

## Plan-stage content check

Before sealing Plan, run `codepatrol change doctor --id <work-id>` and submit
the Plan checkpoint through `codepatrol change transition`. The transition
validates the current branch, event order, declared artifact hashes and owned
directory before creating the checkpoint commit. Keep the prescribed
`### T<id> — ` headings, `Depends on:` clauses, and `Create:`/`Modify:`/`Delete:`
markers exact because Review and Apply consume them as the executable contract.
This structural convention does not replace semantic review.

## Task structure

### T3 — Note store

**Purpose:** Satisfies AC-1 by persisting and listing notes.

**Depends on:** T2

**Files:**

- Create: `src/store/note-store.ts`
- Create: `src/store/note-store.test.ts`
- Modify: `src/cli.ts` — command registration

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `parseNote(raw: string): Note` from T2
- Produces: `class NoteStore { add(note: Note): void; list(): Note[] }`
- Invariants/errors: insertion order is stable; invalid notes fail before storage

**Simplicity proof:** Reuse the existing `Note` parser and CLI registration seam;
new storage is required because no earlier ladder rung persists AC-1.

**Surface delta:** +2 files; one existing registration changes; no dependency,
public configuration, or external runtime state is added.

**Steps:**

1. Add the test below at the public store seam.

   ```typescript
   test("add then list returns the note", () => {
     const store = new NoteStore();
     store.add({ id: "1", body: "hi" });
     assert.deepEqual(store.list(), [{ id: "1", body: "hi" }]);
   });
   ```

2. Run `node --test src/store/note-store.test.ts`.
   Expected red: `NoteStore` is missing; a setup or syntax failure is not accepted.
3. Implement the smallest store satisfying the declared interface and invariant.
4. Run `node --test src/store/note-store.test.ts`.
   Expected green: the new test passes.
5. Run `<graph-identified affected checks>` and then `<broader gate>`.
   Expected: all pass with no new warnings.

**Task result:** changed paths, red/green evidence, deviations, and assessment are appended to `implementation.md`.

## Final tasks

End with explicit migration/rollout and documentation tasks when applicable, then a final verification task that:

- maps delivered paths and checks back to every `AC-N`;
- runs the complete relevant test/type/lint/build/security/performance/accessibility gate;
- inspects the final diff for undeclared work;
- reconciles actual surface delta with the spec forecast and explains every difference;
- records whether a `DC-N` trigger was activated and follows its approved upgrade path if so;
- syncs the graph and refreshes affected domain artifacts;
- states rollback and residual-risk checks.

## Rules

- Exact create/modify/delete paths and public interface names are mandatory. Use line locations only when stable enough to help.
- Tasks include enough pseudocode or complete snippets to remove architectural guessing, but may leave local syntax to the implementer when existing patterns are cited precisely.
- Every command has an expected signal, including what a valid red failure looks like.
- Dependencies and file ownership make concurrency safe; two independent tasks never write the same file or module.
- Every acceptance criterion is covered; every task points back to purpose and scope.
- Every task justifies new owned surface against the selected sufficiency rung and names reusable capabilities first.
- No placeholders, mutable checkboxes, execution results, or unconditional commit commands appear in the approved plan.
