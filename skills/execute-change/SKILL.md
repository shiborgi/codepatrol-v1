description: (codepatrol) Execute one claimed task from a Change in Apply using bounded mutation, test-first verification, assessment, and durable resume evidence. Use only behind codepatrol-apply.

# Execute Change

Execute exactly one claimed task from the currently approved Change. Follow the [portable execution protocol](../_shared/EXECUTION.md), [Change contract](../_shared/CHANGE.md), [Stage Session contract](../_shared/SESSION.md), and [verification strategy](../verification-strategy/SKILL.md).

## Preconditions

- `codepatrol-apply` validated the current Change projection and accepted
  artifact hashes for implementation.
- The task exists verbatim in the approved `plan.md`, its dependencies are
  closed, and the actor holds its Stage Session claim.
- File ownership, acceptance criteria, expected red/green signal, and governing spec/review are explicit.

If any precondition is false, do not mutate. Return the exact missing contract to `codepatrol-apply`.

## Execute

Read all files in scope and their graph neighbors before editing. For behavior change, run the specified check and observe the expected failure; a setup/typo failure does not count as red. For behavior-preserving refactoring, establish characterization coverage at the public seam.

The Apply contract invokes this skill with the single trigger `always-before-task-mutation` from `codepatrol-apply` and from itself for nested work. Apply decides when to invoke this skill based on the trigger table in `skills/catalog.yaml`; do not invoke a different support skill unless a catalog trigger is true.

Invoke [solution-simplification](../solution-simplification/SKILL.md) before mutation. Confirm the task still uses the approved ladder rung, reuses the declared local/platform capability, and introduces no surface absent from the plan. A simpler mechanical implementation within the same interface is allowed and recorded; a semantic simplification returns to review.

Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the task. Do not redesign, bundle drive-by cleanup, weaken checks, change public behavior accidentally, or modify the approved spec/plan/review. Use [domain-modeling](../domain-modeling/SKILL.md) only when the approved task requires those project artifacts.

Run the targeted check to green, graph-affected tests, and the task's broader gate. Invoke [assess-change](../assess-change/SKILL.md) on the task diff. Fix verified blocking findings within task scope and rerun affected checks; scope-changing findings return to the primary workflow.

## Return evidence

Return changed paths, observed red signal, passing commands/results, assessment
findings/corrections, deviations, risks, and the safe next action.
`codepatrol-apply` appends this to `apply/journal.md`, hashes it in the Apply
checkpoint, and closes the Stage Session item only after verifying the evidence.
